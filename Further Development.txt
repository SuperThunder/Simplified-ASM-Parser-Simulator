Test cases:

Same label appears twice
Jump to valid label
	need to have index of label line numbers
	or replace labels with numbers
	preparse file to find all labels, then replace labels with line numbers

Jump to invalid label
Assembly execution starts from code label without number (no base reference - invalid?)



More code than space for code (code overflows label)

If program was to be rewritten (because parser2 is a mess):
	Parse all the file lines into a special struct array type
	Array would have a type variable, that could specify pretty much everything -> could be an enum
	Comment line would have value, label line would have value
	Every permutation of what's generically in a line could have a value
	Or, more simply, it would just be a few values of COMMENT, WHITESPACE, LABEL, or OPCODE
	The generic linestruct would have a type int/enum, a file line number, an asm line number, a char array for the whole line, 3 char arrays for each operand, 3 ints for operands, and a pointer to the next line's linestruct
