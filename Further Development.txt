Test cases:
Same label appears twice
Jump to valid label
	need to have index of label line numbers
	or replace labels with numbers
	preparse file to find all labels, then replace labels with 		line numbers
Jump to invalid label
Assembly execution starts from code label without number
File doesn't exist/can't open


More code than space for code (code overflows label)
